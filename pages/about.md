Anna Palfreeman is a singer/songwriter who lives in Snohomish, WA. She grew up in the Bothell area and has always called the PNW her home. She is also a piano and voice teacher and a mommy to two precious kiddos, Cassidy and Emerson.

Anna has been writing songs since she was in junior high. Writing music is how she processes life—the good, the bad, and the ugly. Her hope is to be honest in her own struggles to help others be honest in theirs. She wants to bring people together through the beauty of being vulnerable through music.

She is inspired by the musical styles of jazz, gospel, and indie pop. Her influences include Billie Holiday, Bon Iver, Sufjan Stevens, Page CXVI, and Ingrid Michaelson.
